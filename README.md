# Racial-Recognition
Partly unfinished racial recognition project made using the power of **Python** that can detect a face in a camera feed and analyze it using DeepFace

It's only a little ~~racist~~ innacurate with it's racial recognition. The facial recognition alone is very powerful however thanks to DeepFace and OpenCV
